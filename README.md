Test 2
Welcome to the Strongbox Maven artifact repository manager's home.

# What's implemented:
* Repositories:
  * Hosted
  * Group
    * Support for repository ordering
    * Support for routing rules
    * Support for nested group repositories
* Indexing
  * Currently using Lucene just for the sake of the PoC, but will be re-worked with OrientDB, or Titan.
* REST API features:
  * Search for artifacts
  * Manage the server's core configuration
  * Manage repositories
* Ready-to-use Java-based REST API Client(s) covering each REST command.
* Logging:
  * Configuration over REST
  * Retrieve logs over HTTP

# What's in the works:
* Proxy repositories
* [Metadata](https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/wiki/Maven-Metadata)
* Logging:
  * Log tailing over HTTP
* Deploy as transaction
* Maven settings.xml generator over REST API

# Upcoming:
